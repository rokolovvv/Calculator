# Calculator
This is my first project with using JS language. It is Calculator!
And I want to tell you a short instruction how it works.
So,to begin, you need to perform the action of entering numbers:
First, enter the first number in the field labeled "a".
Then Select a mathematical operation using the drop-down list.
And finally, enter the second number in the field with the identifier "b".

After the input action, you should click on the "equals" button ("=")

The result will be displayed in the field with the identifier "result".

Also, an auxiliary function in my calculator is the button "C" = Reset. By clicking on it, you can easily erase all data in one click.

That's all i wanted to say you how it works, i think you will use it and thank you for choosing me!<3

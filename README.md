This is my first project with using JS language. It is a Calculator!

And I want to give you a short instruction on how it works. 

So, to begin, you need to act for entering numbers: First, enter the first number in the field labeled "a". 
Then Select a mathematical operation using the drop-down list. 
And finally, enter the second number in the field with the identifier "b".
After the input action, you should click on the "equals" button ("=")
The result will be displayed in the field with the identifier "result".

Also, an auxiliary function in my calculator is the button "C" = Reset. By clicking on it, you can easily erase all data in one click.

That's all I wanted to say to you how it works, I think you will use it, and thank you for choosing me!<3
